/**
 * NOTES:
 *
 * block combines multiple statements into a group. It is also know as compund statement.
 * we group multiple statements into one statement so that we can use multiple statements in place where javascript expects a single statement.
 * variable inside a block are also hoisted.
 * we have 5 types of scope: local, global, script, block and closure.
 * block also follow scope chain just like closure.
