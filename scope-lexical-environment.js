// lexical environment is created when an execution context is created.

// lexical environment means the outer variables inside which a function is defined.

// lexical environment is a local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent (and this chain goes on until global executing context).

// lexical mean hierarchy in coding (example is below).
function f() {
    // here function y lexically sites inside function x.
    function g() {
        console.log('hello');
    }
    g();
}
f();

// whenever we use a variable its value is searched for all the lexical environments, and this concept is know as scope chain.

// we can see global execution context in our web browsers's dev tool source tab by using debugger.
